# EntMent

**EntMent.com** — a trust-first marketplace that matches entrepreneurs (Ents) with mentors (Ments) and lets successful matches share upside (advisor equity, finder's fee, or a structured instrument).

## Why
- Reduce friction and bias in finding help.
- Make incentives explicit and durable.
- Keep conversations inside the platform; share only the signals that matter.

## Canonical & Domains
- Canonical domain: **entment.com**
- entment.org → permanent 301 to entment.com

## Product Pillars
1. **Onboarding** (Ent): guided Q&A → profile JSON.
2. **Ment presence**: lightweight public card; detailed private settings.
3. **Signal-based matching**: no face/name/contact in ranker; use intent, stage, traction, vertical, skill gaps, time, locale, commitment.
4. **Deals**: AI-adjustable legal templates (NDA/MOU/Advisor/SAFE/Finders).
5. **Forum**: Q&A + cohorts; Discussions first, Discourse later.
6. **Compliance**: broker-dealer boundary, KYC/AML for payments/escrow, privacy.

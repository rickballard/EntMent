# Matching Logic (draft)

Core principle: *rank by fit signals, not identity*. Required signals:
- Stage (idea, prototype, MVP, revenue, growth)
- Vertical/tech tags
- Gaps/needs (go-to-market, fundraising prep, data infra, hiring, etc.)
- Commitment & availability windows
- Geography/timezone
- Evidence (short artifacts: 1-pager URL, deck URL)
- Reputation tokens (RepTag style): attestations on specific skills/work, not clout.

Score = Σ (weightᵢ × similarityᵢ). Suppress PII (name/face/contact) in candidate cards until acceptance.

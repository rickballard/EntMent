# Risk & Compliance (non-legal notes)

- **Broker-dealer**: charging success fees tied to capital raises can trigger registration. If fees only for mentorship placement/advisory, risk is lower; if introducing investors, consult counsel.
- **Escrow**: use a licensed payment/escrow partner (e.g., Stripe + third-party escrow). KYC/AML likely required.
- **Privacy**: minimize personal data; encrypt at rest; allow deletion.
- **Crawling**: honor robots.txt; focus on public, licensed sources; rate limit; log provenance.

> These notes are not legal advice. Engage counsel before launch.
